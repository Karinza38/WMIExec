## Usage  

### wmiexec_scheduledjob.py  
Is a python script which authenticates to a remote WMI instance and execute commands via Scheduled Tasks.

To run the script:  
```bash
python3 wmiexec_scheduledjob.py -i <ip_address> -u <username> -p <password> -c <command>
```

### wmiexec_win32process.py  
Is a python script which authenticates to a remote WMI instance and execute commands via `Win32_Process`.  

To run the script:  
```bash
python3 wmiexec_win32process.py -i <ip_address> -u <username> -p <password> -c <command>
```

### webserver_ssl.py  
Is a python script which creates a HTTPS server (with a self-signed SSL certificate). Used to exfiltrate the command's output.  

Before running the HTTP server, make sure to generate the certificates by running:  

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

If everything is done correctly, the server will be running without any error:  
```bash
python3 webserver_ssl.py
```
